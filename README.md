# my-linx-scripts
Some scripts I use on Linux (arch btw). They may be kinda odd looking for you but they work for me :)

What they are and what they do:
## crop.sh
Removes black bars from videos using ffmpeg

## ffmpegAFolder.sh
Converts an entire folder of files (perhaps music) to another file format while keeping the same filename. Usage: `./ffmpegAFolder <source format> <destination format> /path/to/source/folder /path/to/dest/folder '<additional arguments>'`

## osu/start.sh
My osu! launch script (used for launching osu!)
